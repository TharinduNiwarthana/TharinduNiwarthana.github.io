abstract: Background In high-income countries, the prevalence of physical inactivity and non-communicable diseases is high
and it is now well-established that insufcient physical activity is a risk factor for non-communicable diseases. Walkin
for recreation and transportation are efective means of improving population levels of physical activity. Research 
fnds that the built environment (BE) can encourage or discourage walking behaviour, and this association varies 
for diferent age groups and sexes. This systematic review aims to synthesise longitudinal evidence to better under‑
stand how the BE afects recreational and transportation walking for diferent age groups (above 64 years and 18–64 
years) and sexes in high-income countries
Method We will use Scopus, PubMed, SPORTDiscus with Full Text (EBSCO), Business Source Complete (EBSCO), Art 
and Architecture Archive (Proquest), Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals (ProQuest), and Art, Design & Architec‑
ture Collection (ProQuest) databases to search for relevant studies. Reviewers will screen the search results according 
to pre-specifed eligibility criteria for study inclusion in the review. Required data for the synthesis will be extracted
from the included studies to answer the research questions. Further, the methodological quality of the studies 
included in this systematic review will be evaluated using an established instrument, and the resulting quality scores 
will be utilized in sensitivity analysis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
checklist will be followed when reporting the fndings.
Discussion This review will identify BE attributes that are likely to infuence transportation and recreational walk‑
ing for younger and older adults and diferent sexes in high-income countries. The fndings will help policymakers
with making decisions around walkable built environments for older and younger adults and diferent sexes to keep 
them healthy.
Trial registration This protocol of the prospective systematic review is developed following PRISMA-P guidelines
and is registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration ID CRD42022351919).
