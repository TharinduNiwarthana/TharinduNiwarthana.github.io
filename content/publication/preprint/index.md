abstract: Background In high-income countries, the prevalence of physical inactivity and non-communicable diseases is high
and it is now well-established that insufcient physical activity is a risk factor for non-communicable diseases. Walkin
for recreation and transportation are efective means of improving population levels of physical activity. Research 
fnds that the built environment (BE) can encourage or discourage walking behaviour, and this association varies 
for diferent age groups and sexes. This systematic review aims to synthesise longitudinal evidence to better under‑
stand how the BE afects recreational and transportation walking for diferent age groups (above 64 years and 18–64 
years) and sexes in high-income countries.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This is the protocol for a systematic review paper currently under review in a peer-reviewed journal.
